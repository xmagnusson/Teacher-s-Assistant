# Teacher's Assistant
<p align="justify">
This simple web app was created to meet the needs of teachers who have to calculate percentages for each student's test manually to determine the grade. To calculate the percentages teachers would have to type each score into the calculator and get the respective result. This process is repetitive, time consuming, boring and completely unnecessary. This web app automates the process. It takes in the maximum number of points that a student can score on a test and returns a table with all the percentages for all possible scores (with a 0.25 point step) in a user-friendly way. The app aims for simple, practical and appealing design that also offers a dark mode for late night test corrections.

As this web app is supposed to be easily accesible, it was designed primarily for mobile devices. The web app itself is responsive and therefore able to run on desktop as well, but since teachers need to access it quickly and easily, mobile device is the go to platform.
