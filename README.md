# Teacher-s-Assistant

This web app was created to help teachers calculate percentages after they correct tests. It takes in the maximum number of points that a student can score on a test and returns a table with all the percentages for all possible scores (with a 0.25 point step). The app aims for simple, practical and appealing design that also offers a dark mode for late night test corrections.

It is a first version (a prototype) - so it might still be improved, but if you are curious how it looks now you can check it out at: https://xmagnusson.github.io/Teacher-s-Assistant/
